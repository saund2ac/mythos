                  <br>
                        <h3>Zeus</h3>
                        <p> The deity of the sky, the weather, law and order, fate and destiny, and monarchy, Zeus was known as the King of the Gods. He was portrayed as a solidly built, regal, mature man sporting a thick beard. His standard attributes were an eagle, a royal sceptre, and a lightning bolt.
                          </p>
                        <p>As the youngest of the Titans Kronos (Cronus) and Rheia, Zeus was called Zeus. Zeus avoided this fate when his mother whisked him away, giving the Titan a stone substitute wrapped in swaddling blankets, while Kronos devoured each of his newborns.
                          </p>
                        <p>The deity was secretly nurtured on Mount Dikte in Krete (Crete), where he was fed by nymphs on the milk of the goat Amaltheia and protected by the warrior Kouretes (Curetes), whose shield-waving battle dance muffled the sound of the god's cries.
                          </p>
                        <p>Zeus enlisted the goddess Metis in his cause when he reached adulthood. She provided the Titan Kronos with a sorcerous drink that made him vomit the young gods he had eaten.
                          </p>
                        <p>From Tartaros' abyss, Zeus freed the six giant-sons of Heaven. As a token of appreciation, the Hekatonkheires (Hundred-Handed) provided him with lightning-bolts, while the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) supported him with boulder volleys to help him take on the Titanes. Ultimately, Kronos and his allies were vanquished and sent to an underground jail.
                          </p>
                        <p>Zeus and his brothers cast lots to choose who would control the universe after the fall of the Titan gods. Zeus won the heavens, Poseidon the sea, and Haides the underworld.
                          </p>
                        <p>When an oracle foretold that Metis's son would succeed him as King of the Gods, Zeus devoured the pregnant goddess. After that, Athena, their child, was born right out of his skull and into his belly.
                          </p>
                        <p>Zeus married his sister Hera, ruler of the skies, after wooing her in the guise of a cuckoo-bird. However, it turned out that this union of the always arguing sky-god and sky-goddess was not meant to be!
                          </p>
                            <img src="zeus.png" alt="zeus" style=";width:450px;height:200px;" >
                        <p>Mankind was created by Prometheus, who also gave them fire that had been taken from the gods of heaven. Zeus ordered the birth of the first woman, Pandora, as retribution for this deed, and he sent her to Earth with a vessel full of problems to afflict humanity. An eagle was assigned to punish Prometheus, who was captured and bound to a mountain.
                          </p>
                        <p>Zeus made the decision to exterminate the first human generations off the face of the planet by a massive deluge due to their descent into evil and depravity. Deukalion and Pyrrha, a good couple, were spared and later permitted to repopulate the earth by casting stones that turned into men.
                          </p>
                        <p>Enraged at the Titanes' confinement, the earth goddess Gaia (Gaea) called for the Giants to rebel against the Olympos gods. They besieged the celestial stronghold, but Zeus' lethal lightning-bolts destroyed their ruler and numerous more.
                          </p>
                        <p>Typhoeus, the most terrifying giant of his kind, was created by Gaia and placed atop Mount Olympos. The other gods scurried away in terror, and Zeus himself lost the fight when the monster tore the sinews from his limbs, making him immobile. Subsequently, Zeus vanquished the giant in a rematch after Pan stole his strength back, and Zeus confined the behemoth beneath Mount Etna.
                          </p>
                        <p>Zeus enticed numerous mortal women, such as Antiope in the form of a satyr, Kallisto (Callisto) as the goddess Artemis, Danae as a shower of gold, Leda as a swan, and Europa as a bull.
                          </p>
                        <p>Herakles, also known as Heracles, was the deity's favorite mortal son, supporting him through his tribulations and ultimately welcoming him to Olympos as a god.
                          </p>
                        <p>For their impiety and transgressions against the gods, Zeus punished the most notorious villains in mythology, such as Tantalos for stealing ambrosia from heaven, Lykaon (also known as Lycaon) for feeding the gods human flesh, Ixion for attempting to rape Zeus' wife, the goddess Hera, and Salmoneus for attempting to pretend to be Zeus and stealing the worship that was rightfully theirs.
                          </p>
                      <br>
                          <h3>Hera</h3>
                          <p>Hera held the esteemed position of the Olympian queen among the gods, serving as the goddess of marriage, women, the sky, and heavenly stars. Depictions of her commonly portrayed a strikingly beautiful woman adorned with a crown, wielding a regal sceptre tipped with a lotus. Additionally, she was at times accompanied by symbolic animals, such as a lion, cuckoo, or hawk.
                            </p>
                            <img src="hera.png" alt="hera" style=";width:400px;height:400px;" >

                      <br>
                            <h3>Poseidon</h3>
                            <p>Poseidon, the Olympian god, held dominion over the sea, earthquakes, floods, drought, and horses. Artists often portrayed him as a mature man with a robust physique, a dark beard, and a commanding presence. In his hand, Poseidon wielded a trident, a distinctive three-pronged fisherman's spear that symbolized his authority over the realms he governed.
                              </p>
                              <p>Poseidon's mythology is rich and varied, including the following key events:</p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Birth and Rescuing by Zeus: Poseidon was swallowed by his father Kronos at birth, but Zeus, with the help of the goddess Metis, compelled Kronos to disgorge him by giving him a magical elixir.</li>
                                  <li>War of the Titanes: During the war against the Titanes, Poseidon, along with his brothers Zeus and Hades, defeated the elder gods and imprisoned them in Tartaros. The Kyklopes (Cyclopes) crafted a powerful trident for Poseidon during this conflict.</li>

                                  <li>Contest with Athena: In a contest with the goddess Athena over the patronage of Athens, Poseidon created the first horse as a gift. However, when he was denied the prize, he caused drought in the land in frustration.</li>

                                  <li>Involvement in the Building of Troy: Poseidon helped build the walls of Troy, but when King Laomedon failed to fulfill his promised payment, the god sent a sea-monster to ravage the land.</li>
                                  <li>Retribution against Odysseus: Poseidon, angered by the blinding of his son Polyphemos by the hero Odysseus, sent a storm to scatter and wreck Odysseus's fleet on his return from Troy.</li>
                              </ul>
                                <img src="poseidon.png" alt="poseidon" style=";width:400px;height:400px;" >
                            <p>Poseidon was commonly depicted with distinctive symbols, notably the trident—a three-pronged fishing spear symbolizing his rule over the sea. In some representations, he held a boulder adorned with sea creatures like crayfish and octopi. Poseidon's attire varied, ranging from a robe and cloak to a naked form with a loosely draped cloak. Additionally, he often wore a wreath of wild celery or a simple headband, accentuating his regal image. These visual elements conveyed his dominion over the seas and his connection with marine life, capturing the essence of his divine power and presence.
                              </p>
                            <p>Poseidon's revered animals included the bull, the horse, and the dolphin. As the god of the sea, he held a close association with fish and various marine creatures. His chariot was uniquely drawn by a pair of horses with fish tails, known as hippokampoi in Greek mythology. In myth, the most notable of his sacred animals was the Cretan Bull, which fathered the Minotaur. In addition to animals, Poseidon's sacred plants encompassed the pine tree and wild celery. These plants were utilized to create crowns for victors at the Isthmian Games dedicated to the god.
                              </p>
                    <br>

                              <h3>Aphrodite</h3>
                              <p>Aphrodite, an Olympian goddess, held dominion over love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation in Greek mythology. She was commonly portrayed as a stunning woman, frequently accompanied by the winged godling Eros (Love). Aphrodite's symbolic attributes included a dove, apple, scallop shell, and mirror. Classical representations of her in sculpture and frescoes typically depicted her in the nude, emphasizing her association with beauty and sensuality.
                                </p>
                                <img src="aphrodite.png" alt="aphrodite" style=";width:300px;height:300px;" >

                              <p>Aphrodite, the Olympian goddess of love and beauty, is the central figure in several renowned myths. These include her enchanting birth from the sea foam and her involvement in an adulterous affair with the god Ares. Another notable tale revolves around her love for Adonis, a handsome Cypriot youth tragically killed by a boar. Additionally, Aphrodite is known for her affection towards Anchises, a shepherd-prince. The famous judgment of Paris, where she was awarded the golden apple in exchange for the promise of Paris marrying Helen, is a pivotal myth. During the Trojan War, Aphrodite actively supported her favorites Paris and Aeneas, even sustaining injuries in the conflict. Her role in the race of Hippomenes for Atalanta, won with the help of the goddess and her golden apples, is also noteworthy. The tragic death of Hippolytos, destroyed by Aphrodite for scorning her worship, adds a darker dimension to her mythology. The tale of Pygmalion, whose statue was brought to life by Aphrodite in response to his prayers, highlights her divine intervention. Lastly, the persecution of Psyche, a maiden loved by the goddess' son Eros, further explores the complexities of Aphrodite's influence in ancient Greek myths.

                        <h2>The Myths</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Zeus and the pantheon of Greek gods, spanning from Aphrodite to Poseidon, are well-known figures that have captured the imagination of readers worldwide.</p>
                        <p> The Greek tales of gods, heroes, and monsters continue to be told and retold, maintaining their cultural significance even today. The earliest documented versions of these myths trace back over 2,700 years, appearing in written form in the works of Greek poets such as Homer and Hesiod. However, some of these myths have even more ancient origins, as the Greeks incorporated and adapted material from older stories. The enduring appeal of these myths lies in their timeless narratives that explore the complexities of the human experience through divine and mythical characters.

                        <h2>Rites</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The ancient Greeks held a polytheistic belief system, worshipping numerous gods, each characterized by a unique personality and sphere of influence.</p>
                          <p>Greek mythology, which detailed the origins of these deities and their interactions with humanity, was vividly depicted in the art of Archaic and Classical Greece. This art often featured a standardized set of symbols that identified each god. At the core of the Greek pantheon were twelve principal deities. Zeus, the sky god and father of the gods, headed this divine hierarchy, with sacred symbols such as the ox and the oak tree. His brothers, Hades and Poseidon, ruled the Underworld and the sea, respectively. Hera, Zeus's sister and wife, held the position of queen of the gods, typically portrayed wearing a tall crown known as a polos. Athena, the wise patron goddess of Athens, was associated with full armor, the aegis (a goatskin with a snaky fringe), helmet, and spear. Apollo, the god of music and prophecy, and his twin sister Artemis, the patroness of hunting, were also prominent deities. Hermes, the messenger god, was recognized by his winged sandals and the kerykeion, his elaborate herald's staff. Other significant gods included Aphrodite (goddess of love), Dionysos (god of wine and theater), Ares (god of war), and Hephaistos (god of metalworking).</p>

                            <p>Mount Olympus, the highest peak in mainland Greece, was believed to be the abode of the gods.</p>

                            <p>Greek religious practices were rooted in ancient observances, often dating back to the Bronze Age. Unlike other religious traditions, the Greeks lacked a single guiding scripture or a strict priestly caste. Their relationship with deities was based on the principle of exchange, where gods were expected to reciprocate with gifts. Votive offerings, excavated in large quantities from sanctuaries, represented physical expressions of gratitude from worshippers.</p>
                              <p>Religious activities occurred in sanctuaries located within cities or in the countryside, enclosed by well-defined walls. These sacred precincts, called temenos, contained temples housing monumental cult images of deities, outdoor altars, statues, and votive offerings. The choice of natural surroundings often reflected the character of the gods, such as the sea view for the temple at Sounion dedicated to Poseidon or the elevated position of the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis dedicated to Athena.</p>

                              <p>The central ritual in ancient Greek religious practice was animal sacrifice, particularly of oxen, goats, and sheep. Sacrifices took place within the sanctuary, with participants consuming the entrails and meat of the sacrificial victim. Libations, or liquid offerings, were also common. Religious festivals, characterized by feasts, marked various times of the year. The most famous festivals, including those at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and Isthmia, featured processions, athletic competitions, and sacrifices held every four years and attracted participants from across the Greek-speaking world. Local festivals were also widespread, and mystery cults, like the one at Eleusis near Athens, restricted participation to initiates.</p>

                              <p>Prayers typically began with compliments to the deity, followed by discreet references to the petitioner's piety, and concluded with a specific request. When addressing an Olympian, the suppliant stood with raised arms and palms facing upward. Processions were integral to most gatherings and festivals, with the Panathenaic procession being a notable example. It commenced from the Pompeion at dawn, led by maiden basket-bearers carrying sacred items. Elders with boughs and youths with sacrificial victims followed, and cavalry brought up the rear. During the procession, a robe was spread on the mast of a wheeled ship.

                        <h2>Greecian Temples</h2>
                        <p class="lead">In ancient times, deities were worshipped in awe-inspiring locations such as groves, caves, or mountain peaks.</p>

                    </div>

                </div>

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-5 col-md-6">During the Mycenaean era, deities were even worshipped within the king's palace. Central to this worship was the temenos, a designated precinct for the deity, containing essential elements like the altar, temple (if present), and other sacred or natural features. An example is the sacred olive in the temenos of Pandrosos on the Athenian Acropolis. The central chamber (cella) housed the deity's image, initially crafted from crude wood. Although no rituals were directly associated with the image, it was occasionally paraded.
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-5 offset-sm-2 col-md-6 offset-md-0">Many oracular shrines, which often included a subterranean chamber, had traces of rituals to induce divinatory dreams, such as incubation (ritual sleep). However, no such chamber has been discovered at Delphi, despite the belief that the Pythia "descended" during oracles. The oracle of Trophonius, uncovered at Levádhia, involved incubation practiced in a hole. One of the most renowned centers for incubation was the temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus, where the sick sought advice through dreams. Divination practices were widespread in Greece, with augurs interpreting bird flights, dreams, sneezes, and even the shape of altar smoke and the arrangement of sacrificial animals' entrails.

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-5 col-lg-6">  Hero shrines were less elaborate, featuring pits for offerings, and miniature shrines were also known. Temples, known as naoi, were already known in Homeric times. In these early periods, the temples were constructed from wood and had a simple design, as seen in models discovered at Perachora. However, by the end of the 7th century BC, there was a shift to using poros and marble, resulting in larger temples with columns on all sides.

                        <h2>Myths in Art</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The allure of Greek myths has enthralled artists throughout history, dating back to the creation of gods and goddesses in marble by ancient sculptors.</p>
                        <p> The trials faced by ancient Greek heroes and the encounters with monsters have inspired artists across diverse periods, including Renaissance masters, Surrealists, and conceptual artists. While there isn't a singular, cohesive narrative of Greek mythology, works like Homer's Iliad and Ovid's Metamorphoses offer alternative histories of humanity. These sources trace the origins of the first woman and recount the tragic downfall of Troy, providing rich and enduring material for artistic interpretation and expression.

                          <p>Sandro Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus" stands as one of the most famous paintings globally,<img src="close.png" alt="venus.close" style=";width:200px;height:200px;" > created for the influential Medici family, who were Florence's preeminent power during that era. This masterpiece is a highlight within the Botticelli Rooms at the renowned Uffizi Galleries in Florence. Originally crafted for the Medici's villa of Castello, the painting portrays the goddess of love and beauty, Venus, in a striking and nude form.
                            </p>
                            <p>The scene captures her landing at Paphos, Cyprus, emerging from a shell in the sea, with the wind gently blowing and a nymph poised to cover her with a delicate cloak.
                            </p>

                        <h3 id = "phaeton">The Fall of Phaeton</h3>
                            <p>Painted by the Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens, the artwork portrays the ancient Greek myth of Phaeton, a recurring subject in visual arts. Phaeton, son of the Oceanid Clymene and the solar deity Helios, requested proof of his divine parentage. Helios, in response, promised to grant him any wish. Despite attempts to dissuade Phaeton, he insisted on driving the sun chariot for a day. Unable to control the horses, Phaeton approached dangerously close to Earth, prompting Zeus to intervene and strike him down with a thunderbolt to avert disaster. Phaeton fell to his death.
                              </p>
                            <p>In Rubens' painting, the artist chose to depict the myth at its climactic moment, capturing the intensity as Zeus' thunderbolts hurtle towards Phaeton's chariot. Surrounding him are butterfly-winged female figures representing the hours and seasons, reacting with terror as the accident disrupts the natural cycle of night and day. The artwork, titled "The Fall of Phaeton," showcases Rubens' masterful interpretation of the myth, emphasizing the dramatic and catastrophic elements of the narrative.
                              </p>

                        <h3 id = "caravaggio">Narcissus</h3>
                                  <p>The narrative of Narcissus is a frequently retold tale in literature, finding reinterpretations by writers such as Dante and Petrarch and visual representations by numerous Renaissance artists, including Caravaggio.
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="flower.png" alt="narcissus.flower" style=";width:150px;height:200px;" >
                                  <p>According to the myth, Narcissus, a hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia, was renowned for his exceptional beauty. While experiencing thirst during a hunting expedition, he leaned upon the water and caught sight of his own reflection in the bloom of youth. Unaware that it was his own image, Narcissus became deeply infatuated with it, unable to tear himself away from the allure. Realizing that his love could not be reciprocated, he succumbed to his passion and perished, transforming into a gold and white flower.
                                    </p>
                                  <p>Caravaggio's painting, one of two on the theme from Classical mythology, captures Narcissus adorned in an elegant brocade doublet, fixated on his own distorted reflection. Encircled by darkness, the figure is entrapped in a contemplative state, evoking an atmosphere of brooding melancholy. Caravaggio's interpretation skillfully captures the emotional complexity of Narcissus's tragic tale.
                                  </p>

                      <h3 id = "ariadne">Ariadne</h3>
                        <p>In Greek mythology, Ariadne, a Cretan princess, found herself enamored with Theseus, the courageous volunteer who pledged to slay the Minotaur—a mythical creature with the body of a man and the head of a bull, sent to Minos by the god Poseidon for sacrifice. To aid Theseus in his perilous task, Ariadne equipped him with a sword and a ball of thread, enabling him to navigate the labyrinth of the Minotaur and find his way back out. Following Theseus's triumphant victory over the beast, Ariadne chose to betray her father and homeland, opting to elope with Theseus. However, her joy was short-lived as Theseus later abandoned her while she slept on Naxos.
                          </p>
                        <p>Giorgio de Chirico, in this early 20th-century painting, captured Ariadne in a vulnerable state, depicted as she lay sleeping in an empty public square. The work, as interpreted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, reflects de Chirico's personal sense of isolation after relocating to Paris in 1911. The painting not only encapsulates the mythological narrative of Ariadne but also serves as a poignant expression of the artist's own emotions and experiences during a significant period in his life.

                          <h3 id = "leda">Leda and the Swan</h3>
                            <p>The myth of Leda and the Swan, a perplexing tale in Greek mythology, resonates strongly in the annals of art history. In this myth, Zeus assumes the form of a swan to rape Leda, the queen of Sparta, leading to the birth of Helen. The narrative takes a distressing turn as Helen's subsequent actions, running off with or being abducted by the Trojan prince Paris, become catalysts for the Trojan War.
                            </p>
                            <img src="swan.png" alt="leda.swan" style=";width:300px;height:200px;" >

                            <p>This motif of woman and bird, accompanied by the ensuing destruction, has fascinated artists through the centuries. Leonardo da Vinci, although losing both of his versions of Leda and the Swan, inspired renditions by his students. These paintings depict a demure, nude woman holding a swan, with surviving preparatory sketches by Leonardo himself. In the late 19th century, Paul Cézanne portrayed Leda with a swan biting her hand, showcasing a blonde woman's ambivalent expression. French avant-garde artist Marie Laurencin depicted a contemplative Leda dressed in pink, leaning over a black railing to pet the bird. Cy Twombly offered his Abstract Expressionist interpretation, creating a chaotic blend of crayon, pencil, and paint, featuring discernible elements like hearts and a penis. The enduring allure of Leda and the Swan in art underscores its timeless and complex nature.
